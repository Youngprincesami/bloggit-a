            <h2>What is Biometric Authentication?</h2>
            <p>
              Biometric authentication refers to the process of verifying an
              individual's identity by analyzing their unique physical or
              behavioral characteristics. Unlike passwords, which can be
              forgotten or stolen, biometric traits—such as fingerprints, facial
              features, or voice patterns—are intrinsically unique to each
              person, making them nearly impossible to replicate or forge. This
              results in a higher level of security and is quickly becoming the
              preferred method for securing everything from mobile devices to
              online banking and workplace access.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Biometric Authentication Matters</h3>
            <p>
              As we increasingly rely on digital platforms for business,
              banking, and social interactions, the need for stronger, more
              secure methods of identity verification becomes clear. Biometric
              authentication offers significant advantages over traditional
              security methods such as passwords and PINs. With biometric
              systems, individuals don’t need to remember complex passwords, and
              there is a reduced risk of unauthorized access.
            </p>

            <br />
