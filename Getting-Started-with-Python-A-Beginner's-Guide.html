          traditional first step for every new programmer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open your chosen IDE and create a new file called
          <code>hello.py</code>. Then, type the following Python code into the
          file:
        </p>

        <pre><code>print("Hello, World!")</code></pre>

        <p>
          Save the file and open the terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the
          directory where your file is saved and run the program by typing:
        </p>

        <pre><code>python hello.py</code></pre>

        <p>
          If everything is set up correctly, you should see the following
          output:
        </p>

            For example:
            <code>x = 5</code>
            In this case, <code>x</code> is a variable that holds the value 5.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Types:</strong> Python supports a variety of data
            types, such as integers, floats (decimal numbers), strings (text),
            lists, dictionaries, and more. Understanding how to use and
            manipulate these types is crucial for writing effective Python code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Control Flow:</strong> Control flow statements, such as
            <code>if, else</code>, and <code>elif</code>, allow you to make
            decisions in your program. Loops, like <code>for</code> and
            <code>while</code>, let you repeat actions multiple times.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Functions:</strong> Functions are blocks of reusable code
            that help make your programs more organized. For example, here’s how
            you define a function in Python:
            <pre><code>def my_function():
     print("Hello from my function!")
                </code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Once you master these concepts, you'll have a solid understanding of
          the Python language and be ready to tackle more complex projects.
