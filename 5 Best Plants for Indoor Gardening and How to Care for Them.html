        <h2>1. Snake Plant (Sansevieria)</h2>
        <p>
          Snake plants, also known as *Sansevieria* or “Mother-in-Law’s Tongue,”
          are one of the most popular choices for indoor gardening. Their tall,
          stiff leaves and striking appearance make them an eye-catching
          addition to any room. Besides their beauty, they are incredibly
          low-maintenance and can thrive in a variety of indoor environments.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Choose Snake Plant?</h3>
        <p>
          Snake plants are resilient and can survive in low light conditions,
          making them ideal for rooms with limited natural sunlight. They also
          tolerate irregular watering and can go weeks without needing a drink.
          Snake plants are known for their air-purifying qualities, removing
          toxins like formaldehyde from the air.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Care for Snake Plant</h3>
        <p>
          Caring for a snake plant is relatively simple. Here are the basics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Light:</strong> Snake plants prefer bright, indirect light
            but can tolerate low light.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Watering:</strong> Water only when the soil is dry.
            Overwatering is a common mistake, so be sure the soil is completely
            dry before watering again.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Temperature:</strong> Snake plants thrive in temperatures
            between 60°F (15°C) and 85°F (29°C).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Soil:</strong> Use a well-draining soil mix. Cactus or
            succulent soil works best.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)</h2>
        <p>
          The spider plant is another fantastic option for indoor gardening,
          especially if you're looking for a fast-growing, low-maintenance
          plant. With its long, arching leaves and small white flowers, it’s an
          attractive addition to any indoor space.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Choose Spider Plant?</h3>
        <p>
          Spider plants are known for their ability to adapt to various lighting
          conditions and are very easy to propagate. They are perfect for
          beginners and thrive in indoor environments, even in spaces with
          fluctuating temperatures. Spider plants also purify the air by
          removing harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide and xylene.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Care for Spider Plant</h3>
        <p>Taking care of a spider plant is simple and straightforward:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Light:</strong> Spider plants prefer bright, indirect light
            but can tolerate lower light conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Watering:</strong> Water moderately. Let the top of the soil
            dry out before watering again. Avoid letting the plant sit in
            standing water.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Temperature:</strong> Spider plants prefer temperatures
            between 60°F (15°C) and 75°F (24°C).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Soil:</strong> Well-draining potting soil works best.
            Consider adding perlite or sand to your mix for better drainage.
          </li>

        <h2>3. Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)</h2>
        <p>
          Pothos is one of the easiest plants to grow and maintain, which is why
          it’s a favorite among indoor gardeners. With its trailing vines and
          heart-shaped leaves, it’s not only beautiful but also versatile.
          Pothos comes in several varieties with different leaf colors, ranging
          from solid green to variegated shades of yellow, white, or cream.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Choose Pothos?</h3>
        <p>
          Pothos can thrive in almost any indoor environment. It is incredibly
          forgiving and can adapt to low light, making it a great choice for
          areas that receive minimal sunlight. It’s also a fast-growing plant
          that requires very little care. Additionally, pothos is an excellent
          air purifier, removing toxins like benzene, formaldehyde, and toluene
          from the air.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Care for Pothos</h3>
        <p>Caring for pothos requires minimal effort:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Light:</strong> Pothos prefers bright, indirect light but
            will tolerate low light conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Watering:</strong> Water when the top inch of the soil feels
            dry. Avoid overwatering, as pothos roots can rot if they sit in
            waterlogged soil.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Temperature:</strong> Pothos thrives in temperatures between
            60°F (15°C) and 85°F (29°C).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Soil:</strong> A well-draining, all-purpose potting mix
            works best.

        <h2>4. ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia)</h2>
        <p>
          The ZZ plant is known for its striking, waxy leaves and its resilience
          in indoor environments. It’s one of the most forgiving houseplants,
          capable of surviving under conditions that would be challenging for
          many other plants.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Choose ZZ Plant?</h3>
        <p>
          ZZ plants are perfect for beginners because they thrive on neglect.
          They can tolerate low light, infrequent watering, and fluctuating
          temperatures. In addition to being low-maintenance, ZZ plants are
          excellent at purifying the air, removing toxins like xylene, toluene,
          and benzene.

          <li>
            <strong>Watering:</strong> Water sparingly. Let the soil dry out
            completely between waterings, as ZZ plants are drought-tolerant.

          <li>
            <strong>Temperature:</strong> ZZ plants thrive in temperatures
            between 65°F (18°C) and 75°F (24°C).

          <li>
            <strong>Soil:</strong> A well-draining potting mix works best. A
