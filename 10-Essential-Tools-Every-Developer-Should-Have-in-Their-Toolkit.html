            <h2>1. Version Control System: Git</h2>
            <p>
                A version control system (VCS) is one of the most important tools for any developer. It allows you to keep track of changes to your codebase, collaborate with other developers, and manage multiple versions of your project. Git is the most widely used VCS and has become an industry standard. It allows developers to work on different branches of code simultaneously, track changes, and easily revert to previous versions when needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key benefits of using Git include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Track changes:</strong> Git helps you track all changes made to your codebase and allows you to revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborate seamlessly:</strong> Git enables multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s changes. It allows for smooth collaboration, especially in teams.</li>
                    <li><strong>Branching and merging:</strong> Git allows you to create separate branches for new features, bug fixes, or experiments, and later merge them back into the main branch without conflict.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        
            <h2>2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code</h2>
            <p>
                An IDE is a developer’s central hub for writing, testing, and debugging code. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is one of the most popular and versatile IDEs available. It supports almost all programming languages and is packed with features that make it easy for developers to write, test, and debug code efficiently. With a rich ecosystem of extensions, VS Code can be tailored to suit every developer's needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key features of VS Code:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Customizability:</strong> VS Code allows you to personalize your development environment with various themes, extensions, and keybindings to match your workflow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrated Git support:</strong> VS Code has built-in Git control, so you can easily track changes, commit your code, and push it to repositories directly from the editor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Powerful debugging:</strong> With VS Code, you can debug your code easily. It includes an integrated debugging tool that supports breakpoints, call stacks, and variable inspection.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        
            <h2>3. Debugging Tools: Chrome DevTools</h2>
