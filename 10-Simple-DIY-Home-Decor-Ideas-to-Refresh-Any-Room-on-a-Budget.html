            <h2>Create a Gallery Wall with Personal Photos and Artwork</h2>
            <p>
              A gallery wall adds character and a personal touch to any room.
              Gather a mix of framed photos, artwork, or even postcards that
              hold sentimental value or reflect your personality. Arrange them
              on a blank wall using a mix of frame sizes and shapes for a
              dynamic look. Command hooks or adhesive strips make it easy to
              arrange and adjust without damaging your walls.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Use Peel-and-Stick Wallpaper for an Accent Wall</h2>
            <p>
              Peel-and-stick wallpaper is a quick way to add style to your room
              without the permanence of traditional wallpaper. Choose a pattern
              that complements your decor, and apply it to one wall for a
              beautiful accent. This works especially well in small spaces or on
              walls that you want to highlight, like behind a bed or sofa.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tip:</strong> Peel-and-stick wallpaper is easy to remove,
              making it perfect for renters or anyone who likes to change up
              their decor frequently.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Add Floating Shelves to Display Decor Items</h2>
            <p>
              Floating shelves are both functional and decorative. Use them to
              display items like potted plants, books, candles, and decorative
              items. This simple addition not only fills up empty wall space but
              also keeps your favorite items in view. Floating shelves are
              available in various styles and finishes to match any room
              aesthetic.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Upcycle Old Furniture with a Fresh Coat of Paint</h2>
            <p>
              Give old furniture a new lease on life by repainting it. Sand down
              the surfaces, apply a primer, and paint with your favorite color
              to create a piece that looks brand new. This is an affordable way
              to update chairs, tables, or cabinets without replacing them.
              Matte and chalk paint finishes are especially popular for a chic,
              vintage look.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Consider adding new hardware like drawer
              handles or knobs to complete the transformation.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Add Mirrors to Create the Illusion of Space</h2>
            <p>
              Mirrors reflect light and create the illusion of a larger space,
              making them ideal for small rooms. Hang a large mirror or group of
              smaller ones on the wall to brighten up the room and make it feel
              more open. For added style, look for mirrors with decorative
              frames that fit your room’s decor.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Make a Cozy Corner with Pillows and Throws</h2>
            <p>
              A cozy nook filled with soft pillows and throws can make any room
              feel more welcoming. Choose fabrics that are soft and match the
              color scheme of your room. This is a simple way to add texture and
              warmth, especially in living rooms or bedrooms. You can find
              budget-friendly pillows and throws in various colors and patterns,
              allowing you to switch them out seasonally.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Create Your Own Art</h2>
            <p>
              You don’t have to be a professional artist to create artwork that
              enhances your decor. Try painting a canvas in colors that match
              your room’s palette, or create a minimalist line drawing. If
              painting isn’t your thing, consider framing interesting fabric,
              scrapbook paper, or even wallpaper samples for unique and
              affordable wall art.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Use Plants to Bring Nature Indoors</h2>
            <p>
              Plants not only add life and color to your space but also improve
              air quality. Choose easy-to-care-for houseplants like snake
              plants, succulents, or pothos if you're new to plant care. Place
              them in decorative pots or baskets to elevate the look. If you
              have limited natural light, faux plants can be a great alternative
              for adding greenery without the maintenance.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Swap Out Cabinet Hardware for a Fresh Look</h2>
            <p>
              Replacing old cabinet knobs and pulls with new ones is a quick,
              cost-effective way to update your kitchen or bathroom. Look for
              hardware in finishes that complement your decor style, such as
              brushed nickel, matte black, or brass. This small change can make
              a big difference in the look of your cabinetry.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>DIY Candle Holders for a Touch of Elegance</h2>
            <p>
              Make your own candle holders from inexpensive materials like mason
              jars, tin cans, or clay. Add a coat of paint or some decorative
              embellishments for a custom look. DIY candle holders are a lovely
              addition to coffee tables, mantels, or even bathroom counters,
              adding a warm ambiance to your space.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>DIY Idea:</strong> Fill a jar with sand or stones and
              place a tea light on top for a rustic, coastal-inspired candle
              holder.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
