        <h2>
          Understanding Common Allergens: What to Avoid in Allergy-Friendly
          Cooking
        </h2>
        <p>
          Food allergies are a growing concern, and it's important to be aware
          of which ingredients may trigger reactions. Some of the most common
          food allergens are peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, eggs, wheat, soy, fish,
          and shellfish. These allergens can cause anything from mild discomfort
          to life-threatening reactions, so it's essential to understand which
          foods need to be avoided when preparing meals for individuals with
          food allergies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below, we highlight the most common allergens, their potential
          effects, and tips for managing them in your cooking:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Peanuts & Tree Nuts:</strong> Peanuts and tree nuts are some
            of the most common allergens, often triggering severe reactions.
            Avoid recipes that contain any form of nuts, including almond,
            cashew, walnut, and others, for those with nut allergies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dairy:</strong> Dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter,
            and yogurt contain proteins (casein and whey) that can cause
            allergic reactions in people with dairy allergies or lactose
            intolerance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs are a common allergen, especially in
            baked goods. They are often used as binders in recipes and can cause
            allergic reactions ranging from hives to anaphylaxis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wheat & Gluten:</strong> Gluten is a protein found in wheat,
            barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten
            sensitivity, it can cause severe digestive issues and discomfort.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Soy:</strong> Soy is found in many packaged foods, such as
            sauces, dairy alternatives, and processed snacks. For people with
            soy allergies, it’s important to read labels carefully.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fish & Shellfish:</strong> Fish and shellfish allergies are
            often lifelong and can lead to severe reactions. People with these
            allergies must avoid all forms of seafood, including shrimp,
            lobster, crab, and fish like salmon or tuna.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Creative Substitutes for Common Allergens</h2>
        <p>
          The good news is that there are plenty of delicious and healthy
          substitutes for these common allergens. By using alternative
          ingredients, you can create allergy-friendly dishes that don’t
          sacrifice flavor or texture. Here’s a guide to some of the most
          popular substitutes for common allergens:
        </p>

        <h3>Dairy-Free Substitutes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Almond Milk:</strong> Almond milk is a versatile, dairy-free
            milk alternative that works well in baking, cooking, and beverages.
            It's creamy, slightly nutty, and can be used in place of cow’s milk.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Coconut Yogurt:</strong> Made from coconut milk, coconut
            yogurt is an excellent dairy-free alternative. It’s rich in texture
            and can be used in smoothies, as a topping for granola, or as a base
            for sauces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cashew Cheese:</strong> Cashew cheese is a popular non-dairy
            alternative to traditional cheese. When blended, cashews create a
            creamy texture that’s perfect for sauces, dips, and spreads.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-Dairy Butters:</strong> Coconut oil, olive oil, and
            avocado can be used to replace butter in cooking. These oils not
            only offer a healthy fat alternative but also add unique flavors to
            dishes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Egg-Free Substitutes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Applesauce:</strong> Applesauce is a fantastic egg
            substitute in baking. Use 1/4 cup of applesauce to replace one egg
            in cakes, muffins, and other baked goods. It provides moisture and a
            slight sweetness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mashed Banana:</strong> Mashed banana is another excellent
            egg replacement, especially in sweet baked goods like pancakes and
            brownies. Use 1/4 cup of mashed banana for each egg you're
            replacing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flaxseed Meal:</strong> Flaxseed meal combined with water
            forms a gel-like consistency that works as a binder, making it a
            great alternative to eggs in baking. Use 1 tablespoon of flaxseed
            meal mixed with 3 tablespoons of water to replace one egg.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Gluten-Free Substitutes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Gluten-Free Flours:</strong> Gluten-free flours such as
            almond flour, coconut flour, rice flour, and oat flour are perfect
            substitutes for wheat flour in baking and cooking. These flours can
            help you achieve the right consistency and texture in your recipes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rice and Quinoa:</strong> Rice and quinoa are both naturally
            gluten-free and make a great base for side dishes, salads, and main
            courses. Both grains are packed with protein and fiber.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gluten-Free Pasta:</strong> Gluten-free pasta made from
            rice, corn, quinoa, or a blend of gluten-free grains is an excellent
            option for pasta dishes. These pastas have a similar texture to
            traditional pasta and can be used in your favorite pasta recipes.
          </li>
        </ul>
