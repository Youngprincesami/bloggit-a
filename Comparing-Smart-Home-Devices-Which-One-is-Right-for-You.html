            <h2>Voice Assistants: Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri</h2>
            <p>
              Voice assistants are at the heart of many modern smart homes. With
              these devices, you can control your lights, thermostat, music, and
              more—all with simple voice commands. Amazon Alexa, Google
              Assistant, and Apple’s Siri are the three dominant voice
              assistants, and each has its own unique features.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>

                compatibility with smart home devices, making it one of the most
                versatile voice assistants. It also offers a massive range of
                "skills," which are essentially apps that allow Alexa to perform
                a variety of tasks—from checking the weather to ordering a
                pizza.
              </li>

                <strong>Google Assistant:</strong> Google Assistant excels at
                answering complex questions, thanks to its connection to
                Google’s vast search engine capabilities. It also integrates
                seamlessly with Google services, like Google Calendar and Google
                Maps, making it a great choice for users who are already deep
                into Google’s ecosystem.
              </li>

                experience, and can integrate with a wide range of smart home
                products that support Apple HomeKit.

              your home while reducing energy costs. Two top contenders in this
              category are Nest and Ecobee. Both offer advanced features, but

                your habits and preferences, which can help you save on energy
                bills.

                in your home, ensuring that every room stays comfortable. Ecobee
                also integrates with Alexa and Google Assistant, making it easy
